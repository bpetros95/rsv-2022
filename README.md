# rsv-2022

Repo to store .log, .tree, and .xml files associated with Bayesian phylogenetic analyses conducted in "The 2022 RSV surge was driven by multiple lineages," by Adams*, Moreno*, Petros*, Uddin* et al. 2022.

Blog post describing findings currently available at: https://virological.org/t/preliminary-genomic-analysis-of-the-rsv-surge-2022-in-massachusetts-reveals-a-polyphyletic-epidemic-driven-by-the-expansion-of-multiple-lineages/914

.xml files were generated using BEAUti v.1.10.4, while .log and .tree outputs were generated using BEAST v.1.10.5, LogCombiner v.1.10.4, and TreeAnnotator v.1.10.4 (Drummond & Rambaut, 2007).
